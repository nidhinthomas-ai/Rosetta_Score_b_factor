# Rosetta_Score_b_factor
This script takes a pdb file generated by Rosetta and extracts the Rosetta Score. Later, adds the rosetta scores to the PDB file as b-factor. The Jupyter notebook describes the code and plots the structure of the protein using Py3Dmol and colors the structure based on b-factor.
